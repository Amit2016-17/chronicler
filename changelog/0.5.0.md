Including issues:

- fsanaulla/chronicler#129 Reference transparency in `InfluxReader[A]`, read method signature changed from `JArray => T` to `JArray => Either[Throwable, T]`, macros also updated
- fsanaulla/chronicler#148 Reference transparency in `InfluxWriter[A]`, write method signature changed from `T => String` to `T => Either[Throwable, String]`, macros also updated
- fsanaulla/chronicler#138 Core algebra simplification
    - `WriteResult` changed to `Either[Throwwable, Int]`, where `Int` is response code value.
    - `QueryResult[A]` to `Either[Throwable, Array[A]]`
    - `GroupedResult[A]` to `Either[Throwable, Array[(Array[String], A)]]`
    - `PingResult` to `Either[Throwwable, InfluxDBInfo]`
  
  All method signatures were changed respectively.
  
- fsanaulla/chronicler#139 Grouped functionality moved to separate method `readJsonGrouped`
- fsanaulla/chronicler#140 Removing `WriteOperations` and `ReadOperations` abstraction.
- fsanaulla/chronicler#145 Rewriting chronicler-macros, speedup generated code in 10x time. It was overrode using `StringBuilder`
- fsanaulla/chronicler#133 Partial benchmarks implementation as a separate module
